v0.80
    - removed some delays when updating, this should make updating addons a good bit faster. This delay was originally implemented to avoid getting the addon banned from different addon websites, but with the switch to the Twitch API, it shouldn't be necessary for ALL websites.
    - Added preferences menu, currently only contains 1 item and isn't super pretty but the groundwork is laid now. It should be very easy to add additional preferences
    - Added preference to only use "releases" of curseforge addons, previously installed addons will need to wait for a new release or reinstalled to change from alpha/beta builds to release builds

v0.78
    - Added compression to addon exporting, should help with sharing lists (compression done by 'robthemonster#5738' from the Discord)
    - Fixed issue with selecting wow.exe, Blizzard had renamed it from wow.exe to WowClassic.exe

v0.77
    - Added option for classic only filtering for curseforge searches
    - Will now down-prioritize 'alternate' versions of addon when updating

v0.76
    - Bug fix (added conversion for old Tukui addons)

v0.75
    - Added in-app search support for Tukui
    - Bug fix (fixed problem with search field)
    - Bug fix (fixed issue with URL matching)

V0.74:
    - Bug fix (proper saving of update timestamps)

v0.73:
    - added randomized delay to consecutive downloads from same source. Addons will potentially take 300-700 ms longer to download, but should make updating appear less like a DOS attack from the perspective of the addon host.
    - added a 30 min cooldown period between downloading addons from the same source, this can be bypassed by toggling force downloads from the file menu. This should reduce the spamminess of downloading updates/installing new addons several times in one session.
    - added ability to search for curseforge addons through the manager
    - switched to using api for curseforge
    - DISCONTINUTED SUPPORT FOR WOWACE FOR THE TIME BEING
    - *TECHNICAL*
    - Massive restructuring of code
    - Proper separation of API and Scrapers

        - UI now displays custom error for 503 errors explaining what it means

v0.64: Filtering and Update Feedback
    - Slight UI changes
    - Now shows icon next to addons during update process
    - Errors shown at end, will update all it can even if one addon fails
    - Can now search through managed addons

v0.62: Improved updater system, New .exe file
    - New .exe file that shouldn't get flagged as malware
    - Improved updater system, allows for a lot more flexibility on my part
    - The program should now restart after update instead of just closing

    NOTE: This update will require 2 downloads/restart cycles to apply the update, this is because of the format of the new updating system... Anyone updating from a previous version to this version or future versions will need to do 2 restarts, but any updates from this version and forward will be 1 update cycle as usual.

v0.6: Error pop-ups, major UI fixes, Editing of managed addons
    - Editing of managed addons (BE CAREFUL)
    - Pop-ups for ALL errors, no more UI freezing (fingers crossed)
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes

v0.5 Github limit handling and toggle of github downloads
    - This version features a couple small bug fixes as well as pop-up that will inform the user if they hit the github request limit.
    - It also features a toggle for github downloads if you wish to continue downloading other addons while you wait for the request to reset.

v0.35: Auto-Updater, More responsive UI, General UI improvements
    IMPORTANT:
    - To update, just overwrite the old files. You NEED the contents of your old 'data' folder or you will lose the tracking you've set up already.

    - This should be the last version that will need a manual download. From now on the addon manager should check for a new update when you open it.
    - Added fixes for ui hanging
    - Added a bunch of misc improvements to the UI.

V0.3: GitHub support
    - Added github support in this version.
    - Next version will fix the hanging UI, the way you select branches, and the recurring pop-up bug.
